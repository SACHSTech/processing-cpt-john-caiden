# Super Sonic Speedrun!

    Super Sonic Speedrun is a platform jumping based game where the objective is to reach a certain part of the map. There are obstacles placed in the map that will try to prevent the player from reaching the end point.
    
    The mechanics of the game is sonic being able to run and jump. The grass on the background has invisible boundaries that let sonic stay on the platforms and not fall through. Spikes are also placed in the map to try and give the player a challenge or make sure the player stays on the right track to winning. Water is also placed where there is no platform (on ground level) to ensure the player does not get stuck in between platforms. At the beginning of the game, there is an introduction and instructions on how to play. The user is required to press a certain key to continue to make sure they understand the objective and how to play the game.
	
    There is no scoring in the game, rather, the user must complete the course to win and fail if they hit an obstacle or fall in the water. Winning is defined when the user hits the last platform in the map and failing is determined by the user hitting the spikes or falling in the water.
	
    However, there are limitations to the game. Upon the user failing or winning, the “you died” or “you win”  screen appears. However, there is no restart button so the user is forced to quit the current game window and run the program again in order to play the game again. Another bug was in the bottom most right platform, if you jump and land in a certain spot in between the two platforms, the player gets stuck and is unable to move left or right (the only way of getting out was to jump). However, we overcame this bug by placing spikes at that spot and made it so the player dies upon touching the spikes.
